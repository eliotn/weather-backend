#Eliot Glairon's backend weather service

## Functionality

This server provides storage for the mapbox frontend api.  It also has a generate points api call that utilizes random.org and the open weather api to return latitude, longitude, and an icon weather for each location for the frontend api to consume.

## To run

Program requirements: Maven, Java 8

1. Sign up for a mapbox account at mapbox.com.  Then login and navigate to account.mapbox.com.  You should see a Default public token under access tokens.  Copy the token.  Edit src/main/resources/application.properties under the root directory and replace the ${MAPBOX_SECRET} value with this token.
2. Sign up for an account at random.org.  Then login and navigate to https://api.random.org/dashboard.  Click create a new api key, and follow the instructions on the prompt.  Click on the created key and copy the value under API key for the token.  Edit src/main/resources/application.properties under the root directory and replace the ${RANDOMORG_SECRET} value with this token.
3. Sign up for an openweathermap.org account.  Then login and navigate to https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.  Here, you can use the default key or generate one specifically for this application.  Whichever option you choose, copy the token.  Edit src/main/resources/application.properties under the root directory and replace the ${OPENWEATHERAPI_SECRET} value with this token.
4. The server should start in port 8080 by default.  If you want to start it in a different port, you can modify the server.port value in the src/main/resources/application.properties file
4. In the project root directory with maven installed, run `mvn clean && mvn install`.  If the application is configured correctly, all 4 tests should pass.
5. In the project root directory, run the server with the command java -jar target/eliot-glairon-weather-backend-1.0.0.jar.  


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core), you can easily generate a server stub.  
This is an example of building a swagger-enabled server in Java using the SpringBoot framework.  

The underlying library integrating swagger to SpringBoot is [springfox](https://github.com/springfox/springfox)  

Start your server as an simple java application
